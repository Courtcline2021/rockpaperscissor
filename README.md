# rockpaperscissor
Simple game of rock, paper, scissor
Works by having the user pick a number 1 - 3 and the number are assigned to either rock, paper, scissor 
Once the user has selected their number the computer randomly generates a number as well and then it prints out a winner 
** Would like to add a counter to see how many times each player wins and loses**
** Need to also add some value errors in the code to keep it from crashing **
